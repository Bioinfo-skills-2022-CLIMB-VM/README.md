<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Using containers</strong> (such as Docker and Singularity) – currently the easiest method for managing and deploying software, easier sharing of code, and higher reproducibility of the pipelines.</li><li><strong>Workflow languages (Nextflow DSL2)</strong> – workflow managers provide a framework for running analyses. They intrinsically provide a degree of data provenance and are easy to re-run analyses with different datasets or parameters in a range of computing environments.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>GNU/Linux command-line</strong></li></ul>
